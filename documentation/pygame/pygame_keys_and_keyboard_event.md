  ![Two keypresses processed in each frame (pygame snake game)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQams.gif)

When does it make sense to use keyboard events (`pygame.KEYDOWN`, `pygame.KEYUP` see [`pygame.event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html)), and when is it better to get the state of the keys ([`pygame.key.get_pressed()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html))?

[`pygame.key.get_pressed()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed) returns a sequence with the state of each key. If a key is held down, the state for the key is `1`, otherwise `0`. It is a snapshot of the keys at that very moment The new state of the keys must be retrieved continuously in each frame. So you can calculate the resulting movement when 2 keys are pressed with `keys[pygame.K_d] - keys[pygame.K_a]` and `keys[pygame.K_s] - keys[pygame.K_w]`. Use [`pygame.key.get_pressed()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed) to evaluate the current state of a button and get continuous movement.  

```py
while True:

    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    x += (keys[pygame.K_RIGHT] - keys[pygame.K_LEFT]) * speed
    y += (keys[pygame.K_DOWN] - keys[pygame.K_UP]) * speed
```

The keyboard events (see [pygame.event](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) module) occur only once when the state of a key changes. The `KEYDOWN` event occurs once every time a key is pressed. `KEYUP` occurs once every time a key is released. Use the keyboard events for a single action like jumping or spawning a bullet or a step-by-step movement.

Single Action:


```py
while run:

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                fire_bullet()
```

Step-by-step movement:

```py
while run:

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                x -= speed
            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                x += speed
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                y -= speed
            if event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                y += speed
```

  ![Pygame How to check for second press of a key](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vl3gn.gif)

The general approach to firing bullets is to store the positions of the bullets in a list (`bullet_list`). When a bullet is fired, add the bullet's starting position (`[start_x, start_y]`) to the list. The starting position is the position of the object (player or enemy) that fires the bullet. Use a `for`-loop to iterate through all the bullets in the list. Move position of each individual bullet in the loop. Remove a bullet from the list that leaves the screen (`bullet_list.remove(bullet_pos)`). For this reason, a copy of the list (`bullet_list[:]`) must be run through (see [How to remove items from a list while iterating?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1207406/how-to-remove-items-from-a-list-while-iterating)). Use another ` for`-loop to `blit` the remaining bullets on the screen:

```py
bullet_list = []

while run == True:
    # [...]

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bullet_list.append([start_x, start_y])

    for bullet_pos in bullet_list[:]:
        bullet_pos[0] += move_bullet_x
        bullet_pos[1] += move_bullet_y
        if not screen.get_rect().colliderect(bullet_image.get_rect(center = bullet_pos))
            bullet_list.remove(bullet_pos)

    # [...]

    for bullet_pos in bullet_list[:]
        screen.blit(bullet_image, bullet_image.get_rect(center = bullet_pos))

    # [...]
```

**What is `pygame.KEYDOWN`, `pygame.KEYUP`?**

The keyboard events `KEYDOWN` and `KEYUP` (see [pygame.event](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) module) create a [`pygame.event.Event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.Event) object with additional attributes. The key that was pressed can be obtained from the `key` attribute (e.g. `K_RETURN `, `K_a`) and the `mod` attribute contains a bitset with additional modifiers (e.g. `KMOD_LSHIFT`). The `unicode` attribute provides the Unicode representation of the keyboard input.  
[`pygame.key.get_pressed()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html) returns a list with the state of all keyboard buttons. This is not intended to get the key of a keyboard event. The key that was pressed can be obtained from the `key` attribute of the [`pygame.event.Event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.Event) object:

```py
if event.type == pg.KEYDOWN:
    if event.key == pg.K_a:
        # [...]
```

`unicode` contains a single character string that is the fully translated character:

```py
if event.type == pg.KEYDOWN:
    if event.unicode == 'a':
        # [...]
```

See also [`pygame.event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) module and [pygame.key](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html).

If you press **UP** + **LEFT** + **SPACE** then the **SPACE** key doesn't appear to be pressed immediately. You've to release the **UP** or **LEFT** key to get the `pygame.KEYDOWN` event for **SPACE**.  

This is a known bug in pygame and doesn't seem to be solved yet: [Incorrect handling of pressed keys #235](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/235).

Sadly even [`pygame.key.get_pressed()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed) doesn't state the **SPACE** key in this case, so I can't even think a workaround.

While `pygame.K_f` is a key enumerator constant (see [`pygame.key`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html)) the content of `event.type` is event enumerator constant (see [`pygame.event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html)).  
If you want to determine if a certain key is pressed, the you've to verify if the event type is `pygame.KEYDOWN` (or `pygame.KEYUP` for button release) and if the `.key` attribute of the event is equal the key enumerator. e.g.:

```py
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        self.quit()

    # [...]

    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        if event.key == pygame.K_f:
            # [...]
```

A user friendly name of a key can be get by `pygame.key.name()`:

```py
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:

        print(pygame.key.name(event.key))
```
