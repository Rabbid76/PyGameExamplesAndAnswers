The method [`pygame.Rect.move_ip`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#pygame.Rect.move_ip) doesn't return any value. It modifies the [`pygame.Rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) object itself.

So after

>```py
> textrect = textrect.move_ip(-50, -50)
>```

the value of `textrect` is `None`.

Since [`pygame.Rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) is supposed to represent an area on the screen, a `pygame.Rect` object can only store integral data.  

> The coordinates for Rect objects are all integers. [...]

The fraction part of the coordinates gets lost when the new position of the object is assigned to the _Rect_ object. If this is done every frame, the position error will accumulate over time.

If you want to store object positions with floating point accuracy, you have to store the location of the object in separate variables respectively attributes and to synchronize the `pygame.Rect` object. [`round`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round) the coordinates and assign it to the location (e.g. `.topleft`) of the rectangle:

```py
x, y = # floating point coordinates
rect.topleft = round(x), round(y)
```

## Use a rectangle as a frame and limit the object to a rectangular area

If you only want to limit the player to a bounding rectangle, I recommend using [`pygame.Rect.clamp_ip`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#pygame.Rect.clamp)

> moves the rectangle inside another, in place

Define the bounding respectively border rectangle. If the player is limited to the screen, you can get a rectangle that defines the border from the display _Surface_ with [`pygame.display.get_surface()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.get_surface) and [`pygame.Surface.get_rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.get_rect):

```py
border_rect = pygame.display.get_surface().get_rect()
```

Clamp the player [`pygame.Rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) by `border_rect`:

```py
self.rect.clamp_ip(border_rect)
```

You can do this with 1 line of code:

```py
self.rect.clamp_ip(pygame.display.get_surface().get_rect())
```

- [Window border in pygame](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64205777/window-border-in-pygame/64206877#64206877)

Use a [`pygame.Rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) object to limit the a circle to the bounds of the window. In the following `window` is the display _Surface_ :

```py
radius = 16
clampRect = window.get_rect().inflate(-radius*2, -radius*2)
circleX = max(clampRect.left, min(clampRect.right, circleX))
circleY = max(clampRect.top, min(clampRect.bottom, circleY))
```

Explanation:

[`get_rect()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.get_rect) generates a `pygame.Rect` with the size oft the [`pygame.Surface`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface) which is associated to the display. [`inflate()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#pygame.Rect.inflate) generates a new rectangle with the size changed by the diameter oft the circle, where the rectangle remains centered around its current center.  
In the following, `min` and `max` are used to clamp the center of the circle in the area defined by the rectangle.
