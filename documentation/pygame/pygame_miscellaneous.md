- [ImportError: No module named 'pygame'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18317521/importerror-no-module-named-pygame/64494572#64494572)

The current [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) release, 1.9.6 doesn't support Python 3.9. I fyou don't want to wait for PyGame 2.0, you have to use Python 3.8. Alternatively, you can install a developer version by explicitly specifying the version (_2.0.0.dev20_ is the latest release at the time of writing):

```
pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev20
```

or try to install a pre-release version by enabling the `--pre` option:

```
pip install pygame --pre
```

```py

from tkinter import *
import os, sys

root = tk.Tk()
embed = tk.Frame(root, width = 500, height = 500) #creates embed frame for pygame window
embed.pack(side = LEFT) #packs window to the left
buttonwin = tk.Frame(root, width = 75, height = 500)
buttonwin.pack(side = LEFT)
os.environ['SDL_WINDOWID'] = str(embed.winfo_id())
os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'windib'
#if sys.platform == "win32":
#    os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'windows'

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((500,500))
screen.fill(pygame.Color(255,255,0))
pygame.display.init()
pygame.display.update()

def draw():
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0,0,0), (250,250), 125)
    pygame.display.update()
    root.update()

button1 = Button(buttonwin,text = 'Draw',  command=draw)
button1.pack(side=LEFT)

    pygame.display.update()

It is not enough to put the files in the same directory or sub directory. You also need to set the working directory.
The resource (image, font, sound, etc.) file path has to be relative to the current working directory. The working directory is possibly different to the directory of the python script.  
The name and relative path of the python file can be retrieved with [`__file__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#import-related-module-attributes). So the absolute path to the python script is `os.path.abspath(__file__))`. The current working directory can be changed with [`os.chdir(path)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html).  
The current working directory can be get by [`os.getcwd()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) and can be print with `print(os.getcwd())`.

Copy the following at the beginning of your code to set the working directory to the same as the script's directory:

```py
import os

os.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
```

An alternative solution is to find the absolute path.
If the file is in an subfolder of the python file (or even in the same folder), then you can get the directory of the file and join ([`os.path.join()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html)) the relative filepath. e.g.:

```py
import pygame
import os

# get the directory of this file
sourceFileDir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# [...]

# join the filepath and the filename
filePath = os.path.join(sourceFileDir, 'test_bg.jpg')
# filePath = os.path.join(sourceFileDir, '_pycache_/test_bg.jpg')

surface = pygame.image.load(filePath)
```

The same can be achieved with the [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module.
Change the working directory

```py
import os, pathlib

os.chdir(pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent)
```

or create an absolute filepath:

```py
import pathlib

# [...]

filePath = pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent / 'test_bg.jpg'
surface = pygame.image.load(filePath)
```

- [Using global variables in a function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/423379/using-global-variables-in-a-function)  

In Python, a variable declared outside of the function or in global scope is known as a global variable. This means that a global variable can be accessed inside or outside of the function.  
A variable declared inside the function's body or in the local scope is known as a local variable.  
Reading a local variable `x` before it is declared causes the error:

> UnboundLocalError: local variable `x` referenced before assignment

You have to use the [`global` statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html?highlight=global#grammar-token-global-stmt) if you want to be interpret the variable as global variable.
