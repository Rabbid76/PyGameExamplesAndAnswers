If you want to control something over time in Pygame you have two options:

1. Use [`pygame.time.get_ticks()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.get_ticks) to measure time and and implement logic that controls the object depending on the time.

2. Use the timer event. Use [`pygame.time.set_timer()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.set_timer) to repeatedly create a [`USEREVENT`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) in the event queue. Change object states when the event occurs.

## Wait for a period of time

Related Stack Overflow questions:

- **[Why doesn't PyGame draw in the window before the delay or sleep?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63218889/why-is-pygame-not-showing-text-on-window/63218970#63218970)**
- [How to wait some time in pygame?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18839039/how-to-wait-some-time-in-pygame/64701602#64701602)

If you just wait for some time, you can use [`pygame.time.wait`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.wait) or [`pygame.time.delay`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.delay). However, if you want to display a message and then wait some time, you need to update the display beforehand. The display is updated only if either [`pygame.display.update()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.update) or [`pygame.display.flip()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.flip)
is called. See [`pygame.display.flip()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.flip):

> This will update the contents of the entire display.

Further you've to handles the events with [`pygame.event.pump()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.pump), before the update of the display becomes visible in the window. See [`pygame.event.pump()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.pump):

> For each frame of your game, you will need to make some sort of call to the event queue. This ensures your program can internally interact with the rest of the operating system.

This all means that you have to call `pygame.display.flip()` and `pygame.event.pump()` before `pygame.time.wait()`: 

```py
screen.blit(text, (x, y))
pygame.display.flip()
pygame.event.pump()
pygame.time.delay(delay * 1000) # 1 second == 1000 milliseconds
```

In any case, this is not the way to wait or delay something in a typical application. The game does not respond while you wait. Use [`pygame.time.get_ticks()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.get_ticks) to measure the time.  
For instance if you want to show a message on the display, get the current time and calculate the point in time after that the message has to disappear. Display the message as long as the current time is below the calculated time:

```py
message_end_time = 0
run = True
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

    # [...]

    current_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()
    if something_has_happened:
        message_surf = font.render('Important message!', True, (255, 0, 0))
        message_end_time = pygame.time.get_ticks() + 3000 # display for 3 seconds

    window.fill('black')

    # [...]

    if current_time < message_end_time:
        window.blit(message_surf, (x, y))
    pygame.display.flip()
```

## Time

In pygame the system time can be obtained by calling [`pygame.time.get_ticks()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.get_ticks), which returns the number of milliseconds since [`pygame.init()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/pygame.html#pygame.init) was called. See [`pygame.time`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html) module.

You have to draw the image in the main application loop. Use [`pygame.time.get_ticks()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.get_ticks) to get the number of milliseconds since [`pygame.init()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/pygame.html#pygame.init) was called. When the `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN` event occurs, then calculate the point in time after that the image has to be displayed. Display the image after the current time is greater than the calculated point of time:

```py
image_time = 0

run = True
while run:
    current_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

    if image_time > 0 and current_time >= image_time:
        image_time = current_time + 1000 # 1000 milliseconds == 3 seconds

    # [...]

    if current_time >= image_time:
        # draw object or do action

If you want to implement some kind of rapid fire, then the things get more tricky. If you would use the state of `pygame.key.get_pressed()` then you would spawn one bullet in every frame. That is far too fast. You have to implement some timeout.  
When a bullet is fired, the get the current time by [`pygame.time.get_ticks()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html). Define a number of milliseconds for the delay between to bullets. Add the delta to the time and state the time in a variable (`next_bullet_threshold`). Skip bullets, as long the time is not exceeded:

```py
next_bullet_threshold = 0

run = True
while run == True:

    # [...]

    current_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()
    if keys[pygame.K_SPACE] and current_time > next_bullet_threshold:

        bullet_delay = 500 # 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds)
        next_bullet_threshold = current_time + bullet_delay

        if player1.left == True:   ## handles the direction of the bullet
            facing = -1
        else:
            facing = 1  
        if len(bullets) < 5:
            bx, by = player1.x + player1.width //2 ,player1.y + player1.height//2
            bullets.append(projectile(bx, by, 6, black, facing))
```

Calculate the point in time after that the explosion image has to be removed. Add the coordinates of the explosion and the end time point to the head of a list (`explosionList`). Draw the explosion(s) in the main application loop. Remove the expired explosions from the tail of the list.  
With this algorithm it is possible to manage multiple explosions.

Test algorithm:

```py
current_time = 0.5
explosionList = [(4, 1, 1), (3, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3), (1, 4, 4)]
while len(explosionList) > 0:
    for i in range(len(explosionList)):
        if current_time < explosionList[i][0]:
            print(explosionList[i][1:])
        else:
            explosionList = explosionList[:i]
            break
    print(explosionList)
    current_time += 1

It does not work that way. `time.sleep`, [`pygame.time.wait()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.wait) or [`pygame.time.delay`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.delay) is not the right way to control time and gameplay within an application loop. The game does not respond while you wait. The application loop runs continuously. You have to measure the time in the loop and spawn the objects according to the elapsed time. Add the newly created objects to a list. Redraw all of the objects and the entire scene in each frame.

Use [`pygame.time.get_ticks()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.get_ticks) to measure the time. Define a time interval after which a new object should appear. Create an object when the point in time is reached and calculate the point in time for the next object:

```py
object_list = []
time_interval = 500 # 500 milliseconds == 0.5 seconds
next_object_time = 0 

while run:
    # [...]
    
    current_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()
    if current_time > next_object_time:
        next_object_time += time_interval
        object_list.append(Object())
```

Use [`pygame.time.get_ticks`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.get_ticks) to get the current time in milliseconds and set the start time, before the main loop:

```py
start_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()
while True:

    # [...]
```

Calculate the elapsed time in every frame. To convert from milliseconds to seconds, the time difference has to be divided by 1000.  
Render the time text to a surface by ([`font.render`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/freetype.html#pygame.freetype.Font.render)). Note, `.render()` returns a [`pygame.Surface`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html) object and a [`pygame.Rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html). The rectangle can be used to calculate the position of the text. In the following the text is placed at the bottom right, with a margin of 20 to the border of the window:

```py
while True:

    # [...]

    if inventory[coins] < 100:
        current_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()
        delta_time_s = (current_time - start_time) // 1000

        text_surf, text_rect = font.render(str(delta_time_s), (255, 255, 255), size=30) 
        margin = 20       # margin to the window 
        size = (200, 200) # window size
        text_pos = (size[0] - text_rect.width - margin, size[1] - text_rect.height - margin)

        displaysurf.blit(text_surf, text_pos)
```

If you want to show the tenths of seconds, then the calculation of `delta_time_s` has to be changed:  

```py
delta_time_s = (current_time - start_time) // 100 / 10
```

Store the milliseconds when `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN` and calculate the time difference in the main loop:

```py
from pygame import *

screen = display.set_mode((160, 90))

clock = time.Clock()
run = True
started = False
while run:

    for new_event in event.get():
        if new_event.type == QUIT:
            run = False

        if new_event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            start_time = time.get_ticks()
            started = True

        if new_event.type == MOUSEBUTTONUP:
            started = False

    if started:
        current_time = time.get_ticks()
        sec = (current_time - start_time) / 1000.0
        print(sec)

    display.update()
```

## Timer event

In pygame exists a timer event. Use [`pygame.time.set_timer()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.set_timer) to repeatedly create a [`USEREVENT`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) in the event queue. The time has to be set in milliseconds.  
For a timer event you need to define a unique user events id. The ids for the user events have to be between `pygame.USEREVENT` (24) and `pygame.NUMEVENTS` (32). In this case `pygame.USEREVENT+1` is the event id for the timer event.
Receive the event in the event loop:

```py
timer_interval = 500 # 0.5 seconds
timer_event_id = pygame.USEREVENT + 1
pygame.time.set_timer(timer_event_id, timer_interval)

running = True
while running:

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

         elif event.type == timer_event_id:
             # [...]
```

The timer event can be stopped by passing 0 to the _time_ argument of `pygame.time.set_timer`.

It does not work that way. `time.sleep`, [`pygame.time.wait()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.wait) or [`pygame.time.delay`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.delay) is not the right way to control time and gameplay within an application loop. The game does not respond while you wait. The application loop runs continuously. You have to measure the time in the loop and spawn the objects according to the elapsed time. Add the newly created objects to a list. Redraw all of the objects and the entire scene in each frame.

Use the [`pygame.event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) module. Use [`pygame.time.set_timer()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.set_timer) to repeatedly create a [`USEREVENT`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) in the event queue. The time has to be set in milliseconds. e.g.:

```py
object_list = []
time_interval = 500 # 500 milliseconds == 0.5 seconds
timer_event = pygame.USEREVENT+1
pygame.time.set_timer(timer_event, time_interval)
```

Note, in pygame customer events can be defined. Each event needs a unique id. The ids for the user events have to be between `pygame.USEREVENT` (24) and `pygame.NUMEVENTS` (32). In this case `pygame.USEREVENT+1` is the event id for the timer event.  

Receive the event in the event loop:

```py
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == timer_event:
            object_list.append(Object())
```

The timer event can be stopped by passing 0 to the _time_ argument of `pygame.time.set_timer`.

Use [`pygame.time.Clock`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.Clock.tick) to control the frames per second and thus the game speed.  

The method [`tick()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.Clock.tick) of a [`pygame.time.Clock`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.Clock) object, delays the game in that way, that every iteration of the loop consumes the same period of time. See [`pygame.time.Clock.tick()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.Clock.tick):

> This method should be called once per frame.

That means that the loop:

>```py
>clock = pygame.time.Clock()
>run = True
>while run:
>    clock.tick(60)
>```

runs 60 times per second.

See [`pygame.time.Clock.tick()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.Clock.tick):

> This method should be called once per frame. It will compute how many milliseconds have passed since the previous call.

You have to calculate the movement per frame depending on the frame rate.

[`pygame.time.Clock.tick`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html#pygame.time.Clock.tick) returns the number of milliseconds since the last call. When you call it in the application loop, this is the number of milliseconds that have passed since the last frame. Multiply the objects speed by the elapsed time per frame to get constant movement regardless of FPS.

Define the distance in pixels that the player should move per second (`move_per_second`). Then compute the distance per frame in the application loop:

```py
move_per_second = 500
FPS = 60
run = True
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
while run:
    ms_frame = clock.tick()
    move_per_frame = move_per_second * ms_frame / 1000  

    # [...]
```
