The [`pygame.event.Event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.Event) object has two attributes that provide information about the mouse event. `pos` is a tuple that stores the position that was clicked. `button` stores the button that was clicked. Each mouse button is associated a value. For instance the value of the attributes is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the left mouse button, middle mouse button, right mouse button, mouse wheel up respectively mouse wheel down. When multiple keys are pressed, multiple mouse button events occur. Further explanations can be found in the documentation of the module [`pygame.event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html).

The coordinates which are returned by [`pygame.mouse.get_pos()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html#pygame.mouse.get_pressed) are evaluated when the events are handled. You need to handle the events by either [`pygame.event.pump()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.pump) or [`pygame.event.get()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.get).

See [`pygame.event.get()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.get):

> For each frame of your game, you will need to make some sort of call to the event queue. This ensures your program can internally interact with the rest of the operating system.

The current position of the mouse can be determined via [`pygame.mouse.get_pos()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html#pygame.mouse.get_pos). The return value is a tuple that represents the x and y coordinates of the mouse cursor. [`pygame.mouse.get_pressed()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html#pygame.mouse.get_pressed) returns a list of Boolean values ‚Äã‚Äãthat represent the state (`True` or `False`) of all mouse buttons. The state of a button is `True` as long as a button is held down. When multiple buttons are pressed, multiple items in the list are `True`. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd elements in the list represent the left, middle and right mouse buttons. If a specific button is pressed, this can be evaluated by subscription:

```py
buttons = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()
if buttons[0]:
    print("left button pressed")
```

If any button is pressed, this can be evaluated with the [`any`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any) function:

```py
buttons = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()
if any(buttons):
    print("button pressed")
```

Further explanations can be found in the documentation of the module [`pygame.mouse`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html).

![Pygame - Mouse clicks not getting detected](https://i.sstatic.net/UJVKi.gif)

For instance:

```py
import pygame

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 800))

run = True
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False
  
    buttons = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()

    # if buttons[0]:  # for the left mouse button
    if any(buttons):  # for any mouse button
        print("You are clicking")
    else:
        print("You released")

    pygame.display.update()
```

If you just want to detect when the mouse button is pressed respectively released, then you have to implement the `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN` and `MOUSEBUTTONUP` (see [`pygame.event`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) module):

```py
import pygame

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 800))

run = True
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

        if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            print("clicked", event.button)
        if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
            print("released", event.button)

    pygame.display.update()
```

While `pygame.mouse.get_pressed()` returns the current state of the buttons, the  `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN` and `MOUSEBUTTONUP` occurs only once a button is pressed.
